# Time-Series Data Interpolation and Extrapolation
This repository contains Python functions for handling time-series data, including filling gaps, converting data frequencies, and extrapolating future values. The functions are designed to work with datasets that include a date column and numerical values. It currently handles linear and exponanential rates of change and the time units: days, months, and years. Can convert timeseries from monthly to daily or from yearly to monthly.

see example_usage.ipynb for a demonstration.
